# 90's Style Portfolio

This repository contains a very simple personal website inspired by the web design of the 1990s. It has a left-side menu and a timeline style main page.

Available pages:

- **index.html** - main page with a timeline of posts.
- **whoami.html** - your portfolio page.
- **archive.html** - where you can list all posts from the timeline.
- **contact.html** - contact form and contact information.

Styling is defined in `style.css`. Background is white, text is black and links are blue to keep that classic feel.
